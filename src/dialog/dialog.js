intro0: `It was a day just like any 
other. I was siting in my 
office, a room that is more..`,
intro1: `often known as my bedroom. 
This is where I operate my 
detective business. I try..`,
intro2: `to make a name for myself 
here. Not a lot of cases 
coming to my desk. But 
whatever turns up...`,
intro3: `
I leave no stone unturned...`,

        .........`,
intro5: `Just when I thought I'd have 
to close up shop for the day, 
opportunity came knocking at 
my door.`,

intro6: `Opportunity in the name of a 
young girl named Dottie.... `,
intro7: `Dottie looked a mess of tears,
not like her usual cheery self. 
What could have made her... `,

horrible, just horrible!`,
intro10: `Chase: What seems to 
be the trouble?`,
intro11: `Dottie: Chase Ventura,
you've got to help me! It's 
my teddy, he's missing!`,
intro12: `Chase: Suppose you 
tell me about it from the very 
beginning....`,
intro13: `Dottie: This morning I was
out playing with my teddy
in front of my house`,
intro14: `I was just setting out my 
plates for the tea party, and 
when I turned around and all of 
a sudden my teddy is gone!`,
intro15: `Chase: Are you sure you didn't 
just misplace him? He couldn't
have up and walked away now 
could he?`,
intro16: `Dottie: I looked everywhere,
and he isn't anywhere to be 
found. Can't you help me?!`,
intro17: `I hate to see a young girl cry.
There wasn't much to go off of, 
but when you're in my line 
of work...`,
intro18: `...any case at your doorstep 
needs to be looked into....`,
intro19: `Chase: Alright, Dottie. I'll
see what I can do, let me walk 
around the block and take 
a look.`,
