### This was my team's submission for Global Game Jam 2021. Global Game Jam¬Æ (GGJ) is the world‚Äôs largest game creation event taking place around the globe. This year‚Äôs theme was ‚Äúlost and found‚Äù and the team decided that a private investigation / noir type game would be fun.

#### Please note that this is a Game Jam Game built under a time constraint, so the code isn't very good. Lots of repeats, hardcoded values, and other basic mistakes that go against most coding best practices. In a proper project, there are a lot of things that would be done differently üòÄ

#### Description: It's a Mystery, and Chase Ventura is on the case! Help Kid Detective Chase Ventura solve the case of the missing toys in this noir pixel game! Use the mouse to point/click and Keyboard (Arrow or WASD) keys to move. Recommended Browser: Google Chrome
